# LtShifty_F16_SimPit
Here are my design files for my F16 SimPit. These are only for the electronics panels, the frame for the Pit was purchased from Tejay, please contact me and I will happily forward his details to you.

They are provided free of charge strictly for non-commercial use, if you would like to use these for a commercial venture please get in touch and we can discuss.

All reference images are kindly provided with permission by https://xflight.de, all copright of these images remain solely that of xflight.de.

All designs are saved in SVG format, and I highly recommend using Inkscape to modify them. As of writing these are still work in progress, I will update and upload files as and when I progress on my personal SimPit. 

Any questions please feel free to ask, you can contact me at ltshifty@outlook.com or find me in the Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/dcsworldsimpits/ as James Seddon.
